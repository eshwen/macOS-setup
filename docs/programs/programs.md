# Programs

Here you can find a list of programs that may be useful for Mac users. The list is not exhaustive, but it's a good starting point for setting up a new machine.

## Fonts

There are some nice fonts I've found over the years in the [fonts] directory. To install them to the system's Font Book, just highlight them all in the Finder and double click.
