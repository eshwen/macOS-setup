## VS Code

In Visual Studio Code, the `settings.json` file can be edited to override some default commands. My current list of installed extensions are

- bibtexLanguage
- GitLens
- LaTeX Workshop
- markdownlint
- Project Dashboard
- Pylance
- Python
- Rainbow CSV
- Remote - SSH
- Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files
- Spell Right
- vscode-icons

and the settings file is [vscode_settings.json](vscode_settings.json). Even though it should be backed up to my GitHub account (`@eshwen`), a cold copy could be handy. Make sure the Python path reflects whatever version I have installed. It can be switched on-the-fly in any case.
